TAssist is a **desktop application** for Teaching Assistants (TAs) from NUS School of Computing to easily track and manage student information. It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI), complemented by a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAssist helps you complete student management tasks more quickly than traditional GUI-based apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to a folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TAssist.

4. Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)

5. Navigate to the folder where you saved the `[CS2103T-W12-4][TAssist].jar` file using `cd` command<br>
   Example (Windows): `cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads`. <br>
   Example (Mac/Linux): `cd /Users/YourName/Downloads`.

6. Type the following command and press Enter to run the application.<br>
    ```java -jar [CS2103T-W12-4][TAssist].jar```

7. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

8. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
    Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@u.nus.edu s/A0135246R` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the student list.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

9. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tips

1. If you are already familiar with TAssist, you can jump straight to our [Command Summary Table](#Command-summary) to view all available commands.

2. To access this User Guide quickly, simply press `F1` key at any time.

3. TAssist allows users to personalize the appearance of the application by switching between different color themes.<br>
   Users can press the `F2` key to cycle through the available themes. <br>
   Available themes: Dark, Bright, Pink

4. Viewing Upcoming Events Calendar: `F3`<br>
   TAssist provides a calendar-style view to help you visualize upcoming assignments and timed events. Events are grouped and displayed by their due dates, along with the list of students assigned to each.
    * Press the F3 key to open the calendar-style event viewer.
    * Display includes: Assignment names, Event type (e.g., assignment), Assigned students, Dates grouped chronologically
    * An empty calendar will be shown if there are no current Assignments.

5. Use student ID and index interchangeably.<br>
   Most commands support both student ID and list index. 
   For example:<br>
   `github 1 g/https://github.com/johndoe`<br>
   or <br>
   `github A1234567B g/https://github.com/johndoe`<br>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters with prefix (p/, c/ etc.) can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

* All parameters follow the rules as specified at [Parameters](#parameters)

### Viewing help : `help`

Opens the User Guide in your default browser and displays a message containing the link. <br>
If the browser does not open automatically, you can manually copy and paste the link into your browser.
![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Adding a student: `add`

**Adds** a student to the student list.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL s/STUDENT_ID [g/GITHUB_URL] [r/REPOSITORY] [pt/TEAM] [c/CLASS_NUMBER] [t/TAG]…​ [pr/PROGRESS]`
* The parameters `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, and `STUDENT_ID` must be present. The rest are optional.
* For more detailed information on each parameter, please read [Parameters](#parameters)
* **Note:** Ensure that the `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `STUDENT_ID`, and `GITHUB` entered are unique, to avoid a duplicate entry error.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong> A student can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Examples:

![add_command](images/AddCommand.png)
### Listing, Filtering and Sorting students : `list`

Shows a **list of all students** in the student list.

Format: `list [f/FILTER_TYPE fv/FILTER_VALUE] [s/SORT_TYPE o/SORT_ORDER]` <br>

* All parameters are optional. Filters and sorting can be used together or independently.
* **Note:** Once a sort is applied using the list command, the list will remain sorted in that order throughout the session.
  To apply a different sort, use list again with a new sort type and order.
  If a sort is applied on a field where multiple students share the same value, their positions may change randomly after add/edit/update operations due to tie-breaking by the system.

#### Filter Options
`FILTER_TYPE:`<br>
* progress: Filters students whose progress is less than or equal to the provided value.
* team: Filters by existing team names.
* class: Filters by existing class number.

`FILTER_VALUE:`<br>
* PROGRESS: An integer between 0 and 100.
* TEAM: Must match an existing team name.
* CLASS: Must match an existing class number.

#### Sort Options
`SORT_TYPE:`<br>

* progress
* github

`SORT_ORDER:`<br>
* asc — Ascending (A → Z or lowest → highest).
* des — Descending (Z → A or highest → lowest).

Examples:
* `list`<br>
  Displays all students.
* `list f/progress fv/60` <br>
  Displays students with progress ≤ 60.
* `list s/github o/asc`<br>
  Displays all students, sorted by Github username in ascending lexicographical order.
* `list f/progress fv/50 s/name o/des`<br>
  Displays students with progress ≤ 50, sorted by name in descending lexicographical order.

* You can remove all the student's tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.
* **Tip:** `edit` cannot be used to remove optional fields `Github` and `class`. To do so, refer to the respective sections [Class](#assigning-or-removing-a-tutorial-class-class) or [Github](#updating-a-students-github-link-github)


Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu`<br>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAssist home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
